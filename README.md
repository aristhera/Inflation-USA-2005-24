# Inflation-USA-2005-2024
This is a school project for data analysis. Looking at https://edition.cnn.com/election/2024/exit-polls/national-results/general/president/0 strongly suggests that Trump was elected for economical reasons that are not only unsubstantiated but simply wrong, so we ask: Has there been any significant inflation in the USA? Let's have a look at the CPI-Data on https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-average-price-data.htm and analyse it via LibreOffice Calc and/or Python. Consensus in every central bank around the world is annual growth of close to but slightly below 2%. So we take the mean of CPI's 2005 values * 1.019**19 (2005 - 2024) and subtract the mean of 2024. Of course this is easier done in Excel so I uploaded an LibreOffice Calc file, too. If you c&p from a html-table like https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-average-price-data.htm, Calc will strip all leading zeros so you'll need regexes like [0-9]{3} / 1000; [0-9]{2} / 100 and so on in search and replace.
